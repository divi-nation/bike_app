//logic for slide

what i want to do
    i want to refresh the slide div 
    and everytime i do, i want to change 
    the post it fetches

stakeholders
    post id variable



solution on how to do it
1. put the query and the final echo variables in one div - so
   once you refresh that div, every thing refreshes

2.create a javascript function that contains a variable that changes 
   after a set time

3. get the javascript variable and use it as the id in the php tag query

4. refresh the div after a set time
